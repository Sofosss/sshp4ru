### *sshp4ru  is a high-performance, parallel SSH executor, rewritten in **Rust**, based on the C-based [`sshp`][sshp] project by [Dave Eddy][dave-eddy] and [Rany]. This tool is designed to execute SSH commands concurrently across multiple hosts, managing the associated SSH connections efficiently and coalescing the output in a systematic manner.*

# About

The original [`node-sshp`][sshp-node] was developed in **Node.js** and was later rereleased in **C**. This adaptation was based off the **C** version, which offered a straightforward solution for managing multiple SSH processes in parallel. The project was well-regarded for its ability to handle a large number of concurrent SSH connections while efficiently managing their output. The **sshp4ru** project re-implements this functionality in **Rust**, a systems programming language known for its memory safety, concurrency and performance guarantees. This rewrite ensures that the tool remains robust and resilient to memory-related issues.

# Installation

Before using `sshp4ru`, make sure you have **Rust** >= **2021** installed on your system.
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sofosss/sshp4ru.git
   cd sshp4ru
   ```
2. Install the CLI binary:
    ```bash
    cargo install --path . --release
    ```
> [!NOTE]  
> The compiled binary will be located in the  **~/.cargo/bin directory** (which should be in ***PATH***). 


3. **Alternatively**, compile the CLI binary and copy it manually:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    cp ./target/release/sshp4ru /usr/local/bin
    ```
  
4. Verify the installation by checking the version:
    ```bash
    sshp4ru --version
    ```

# Functionality and Interface

- The functionality of `sshp4ru` is identical to the [C-based implementation][sshp] of `sshp`. The core features and behavior have been preserved.

- The [command-line interface (CLI)][usage] remains unchanged, meaning you can use `sshp4ru` in the same way you would use `sshp`. The only difference is the name of the executable (`sshp4ru`) when running commands. 

- The handling of exit codes follows the same conventions as the `sshp` implementation, ensuring compatibility. For detailed information on how exit codes are used, you can refer to the documentation of [`sshp`][exit-codes].

- To check the functionality of `sshp4ru`, you can refer to the [examples] from the [C-based version][sshp]. The interface, arguments and expected results will be the same.

### Example:

If the C-based implementation command was:
```bash
sshp -f hosts.txt -m 3 uname -v
```
The equivalent command with sshp4ru would be:
```bash
sshp4ru -f hosts.txt -m 3 uname -v
```

# Testing and Style

The test suite included in this version of the project was originally part of the [C-based implementation][tests] and has since been adapted to the Rust version.

> [!NOTE]  
> In order to run the tests, you should use cargo build instead of cargo build --release. The compiled binary will be located in the ./target/debug/ directory when using the standard build configuration.

The style requirements are minimal and are incorporated via the `cargo fmt` command based on [`rustfmt.toml`][style] file. They ensure:

* Each line has maximum width of 100 columns.
* Each tab equals 4 spaces.
* We use spaces both for identation and for alignment.
* We use a compressed layout of function parameters.

# Future Work
In the pursuit of self-improvement, any new suggestions, solutions and potential bug fixes are welcome. Just **open an issue** or **submit a pull request**.

The following features and enhancements are potential candidates for future development:

- Implementing ``kqueue`` for event monitoring to enhance event handling on systems that support **kqueue**.
- Publish the project on **crates.io**.
- Adding a **password login timer** to enforce a time limit for password-based logins.
